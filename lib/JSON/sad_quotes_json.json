It is more important than appearance, giftedness, or skill. It will make or break a company... a church... a home.

We cannot change the inevitable. The only thing we can do is play on the one string we have, and that is our attitude... I am convinced that life is 10% what happens to me and 90% how I react to it. And so it is with you... we are in charge of our attitudes.",
